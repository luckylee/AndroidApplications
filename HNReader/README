It is the Android prototype application to get the HackerNews (https://news.ycombinator.com/)
stories via exposed public API, which is documented here: https://github.com/HackerNews/API

[Requirements and Features]
Currently, it provide the below features
● Reads news stories from the HackerNews API
● Presents these stories in descending date order to the user
● Allows the user to view the most highly ranked articles
● Allows the user to launch the link associated with the article in their browser

[Design concept and architecture]
This prototype application implements MVC architecture using the following technical stacks.
Kotlin, Coroutines. View-Model design
UI: Fragment, ViewPager2, RecyclerView, and WebView
Data: Room related service
Network: Retrofit related service

[Clarification]
 Allows the user to view the most highly ranked articles
 - Now query the Top stories list for this.
 - Or the requirement means to get the new stories and are ranked by 'score'?

[TODO]
- Time out mechanism for long time data loading.
- Error handle for fetch data failure
- Test for HackerNewRepository
- Try to use Retrofit coroutine after Retrofit 2.6
- Espresso Test to validate UI ?
